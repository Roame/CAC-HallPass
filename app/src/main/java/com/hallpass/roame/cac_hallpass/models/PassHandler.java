    //Hello!

    /*General structure:
    * 1. Some way of storing the user's inputs from the pass form screen, probably a class filled with just variables
    *       - Make it public so I can get it elsewhere in the program
    *       - I'll make sure the fields get filled with any of the info you need, just leave a comment saying what's needed
    *
    * 2. A timer to last however many seconds the user specifies
    *       - I'm going to need the time remaining elsewhere in the program, so make it a function I can call
    *
    * 3. Some function that checks to see if the timer has ended
    *       - This can just be a loop (just don't break the program).
    *       - If you feel like it, create an interface so that when the clock ends, you call an interface function which will trigger events elsewhere, which I can set up outside of this class
    *
    *
    *   I'll make sure that everything is hooked up correctly to other parts of the app once you are done
    *
